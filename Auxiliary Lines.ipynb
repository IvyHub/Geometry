        "Proving a proposition in planar geometry is like an outdoor exploration -- to find a path from the starting point (the problem) to the destination (the conclusion). Yet the path can be a broad highway, or a meandering trail, or -- you may even find yourself in front of a river. \n",
        "\n",
        "The auxiliary lines are the bridges to get you across. Such lines are indispensible in many problems, or can drastically simplify the proof in others. Just like there is no universal rule on where or how to build the bridge for all kind of terrains, the auxiliary lines have to be designed for each individual problem. Difficult as it can be for beginners, the process of analyzing the problem and finding the solution is rigorous, creative, fascinating and extremely rewarding. This booklet is intended to give you a helping hand."

Since the relation between the conditions and the conclusions are implicit, a direct proof can be hard. If we say the difficulty of Example 7 and Example 8 is to divide a complex problem into several simpler ones, then the trick for Example 9 and 10 is to convert the implicit relations between the conditions and the conclusions into explicit ones. In order to do such complicated conversions, we often resort to \"intermediary\" angles or line segments, for which auxiliary lines are drawn. For example, in Example 9, first we added two auxiliary lines $OM$ and $ON$ to prove $AM=AN$, then two more lines $OC$ and $OD$ to prove $OM=ON$, and finally two auxiliary circles through $O, C, A, M$ and $O, D, N, A$ to prove $\\angle OMC = \\angle OND$.\n",

Note that if the three points $C, P$, and $B$ are collinear, we will have $CD^2=CP\\cdot CB$. Then as long as we can prove $AC^2=CP\\cdot CB$, the conclusion will follow.\n",

So, the thinking process, the ways of adding auxiliary lines or even conclusions in \"Basic problems\" can be the bases of solving advanced problems. But sometimes this can come the other way. For example, Example 14 in \"Basic problems\" states that \"if $P$ is a point in the arc $\\widearc{BC}$ of the circumcircle of an equilateral triangle $ABC$, then $PA=PB+PC$.\" (Figure 99).\n",

By applying this theorem directly, we can come to the conclusion without adding any auxiliary line. Divide both sides of equation $PA\\cdot BC=PC\\cdot AB+PB\\cdot AC$ by the length of the side of the equilateral triangle, we get $PA=PB+PC$ directly.\n",

In this pamphlet, we do so only to introduce basic methods before progressing to harder problems, and we hope it can help the readers to master the approaches to convert complex problems into simple ones by adding auxiliary lines."
